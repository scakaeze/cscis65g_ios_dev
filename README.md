# CSCI-S65G Course Desscription

This course introduces the basics of contemporary mobile application development using Apple's iOS technology as the development platform. We begin by surveying the major features of the Swift programming language and system library, along with basic use of the Xcode integrated development environment (IDE) for development. Language features include closures, optionals, the Swift type system (tuple/enum/struct/class/func), and generics. Then we extend the programming model to incorporate the Cocoa Touch framework (for both the iPhone and iPad), making extensive use of Apple's interface builder technology. Specific interface builder techniques explored include auto-layout, constraints, and size classes. Specific Cocoa Touch features include Apple's model/view/controller paradigm and supporting classes, event handling, core graphics, and the UIKit. Finally, Apple's runtime analysis tool, Instruments, is used to explore the details of the Apple memory model and performance debugging. Frequent small assignments progress from basic programming to realistic application development with a focus on responsive device graphics and algorithms. Code design and architecture are emphasized.
